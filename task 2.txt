1)what is the difference between copy_by_value vs copy_by_reference?

copy_by_value:
So basically in a primitive data type when  a variable is assigned a value 
inside the box the value assigned to the varible is stored 

for example:
var x=17;
var y='xyz';
var a=x;
var b=y;

in above x and y are copied to a and b both x and a , y and b contains same value
they are not connected to each other.It is so because the values are directly copied into the new variables
changes takes places in one dose not affect the other.

COPY_BY_REFERENCE:

in case of non-primitive data type the values are not directly copied.
for example:
let user={name:'ram'}
let admin=user;
admin.name='venky'; //value changed
console.log(user.name); //venky

see here when the value of admin is changed it automatically changes the value of user as well
when one changes the value in the allocated memory it is reflected in the other as well.

2)How to copy by value a composite datatype (array+objects).?

For composite data types objects are copied by reference.Actual variable and copied variable both refer to same memory.
so once change is occured both orginal and copied data were effected .

to aviod this problem there is something called spread operator(...)
by using this operator the orginal remains same and the copied is changed when a new value is assigned.
